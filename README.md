# CS133b-FinalProject
CS133b FinalProject Caltech Course (WI 2024)

A variety of RRT algorithms are were applied in a 2d system, a 3 link planar arm, and a 4 link planar arm.
Each subject (2d system, a 3 link planar arm, and a 4 link planar arm) have their own corresponding folder. 
Within each folder are different types of RRT algorithms, refer to ME_CS_EE_133b_Final_Report.pdf file for more information 
about the project and the different variation of the RRT algorithm used. 

Here is a google drive link to the video of the finished project:
